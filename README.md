# Superhero

This project is the result of a "let's code together" experiment for CocoaHeads HH 03/2020

We use the Superhero API to build a little superhero competition game. For more information about the Superhero API have a look at https://www.superheroapi.com.

The Keynote presentation in the project repository shows the idea behind the experiment.

The game is not finished yet, feel free to continue programming and have fun :-)
